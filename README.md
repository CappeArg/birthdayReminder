# Birthday Reminder

Resume:
The company sended its customers an email on their birthday. It always made a birthday card for everyone. It has spent a lot of time doing that and sometimes the company has forgotten the birthday's date because It didn’t have a calendar event or didn’t watch social media birthday reminders.
